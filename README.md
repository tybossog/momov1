The payment-form.php contains the payload required to process the transaction (price, account number ...)

You can modify the payment-form.php file as needed to process the transaction in accordance with momo documentation.

While the process-payment.php form should be used in making the api request to mtn-momo and returning the appropriate responses as needed in accordance with momo documentation.
